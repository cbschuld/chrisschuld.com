Taking a screenshot on the Mac with a perfect shadow is fast and built in.  I take a fair amount of screen shots with terminal windows and web browsers and have found the built in screen grab to be perfect.

First, hit CMD + SHIFT + 4

Next, hit the Spacebar

Now, your screenshot will created and saved with a nice drop shadown.  On OSX Mojave it will also allow you to edit and markup your image.
