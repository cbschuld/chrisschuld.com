I am Chris Schuld and I live in Chandler, Arizona.  When I was ten years old I was shown [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) by my fifth grade teacher and I fell in love with the idea I could control a computer.  I spent a lot of my time in front of the computer attempting to mimic software I saw in magazines and wishing I could [afford a hard drive](https://www.pcworld.com/article/127105/article.html) in the 80s.  Fast forward... earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Systems Engineering from [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu/). I spent a few years at [Intel Corporation](https://intel.com/) before leaving to start my own ventures.

My passion resides in software architecture, rapid development approaches, serverless delivery, software design fundamentals and SaaS business strategy. I actively maintain several profitable production products in React JS, TypeScript, PHP, Node, C#, Python, Perl and Javascript.  You can [read more about my open source projects](/projects) as well.

### About this site

This site was created and is maintained with Jekyll.  I chose Jekyll specifically to decrease the amount of time I spend going from idea to publish.  In the past I was not able to keep up with the authoring of posts (the site was essentially dead for years) because it was not fluid to author content.  I enjoy [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and find it easy to author content in Markdown.  Thus, Jekyll provides me a rapid platform to blog with.

For those curious here is how I produce the site:
+ Uses Jekyll 3.8
+ Hosted by GitHub via GitHub Pages
+ Encrypted using Let's Encrypt
+ Authored using Markdown on Visual Studio Code
+ Uses the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
